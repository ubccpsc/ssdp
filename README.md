## Overview

Producing great software as fast as the market demands requires great, productive developers. Yet, what does it mean for an individual developer to be productive, and how can we best help developers to be productive? To answer these questions, researchers in software engineering have been, and are still predominantly looking at the output that software developers create, such as the applications, the source code, or the test cases. This output-oriented focus misses one of the most essential parts in the process of software development: the individual developer who creates the software.

Recent advances in technology afford the opportunity to collect a wide variety of detailed information on a software developer and her work, ranging from the number of resolved work items all the way to the cognitive load the developer experiences while working. The availability and accessibility of data on each developer is enabling us to explore questions about developer productivity in powerful new ways. 

In this course we investigate how we can ensure the human ingenuity and smarts are being amplified by the processes and tools used to create systems, rather than the humans spending precious cognitive effort dealing with mundane or unnecessary problems.

The course will be adjusted according to your feedback, interests, and experience. This is an overview of the kinds of topics we could cover:
* developer productivity
* biometric sensing
* tool support for software developers
* work fragmentation and interruptions
* self-monitoring and goal setting
* program comprehension
* software evolution
* quantitative and qualitative evaluation of SD research

## Format

This will be a project and paper-based course. The research project is the primary artifact of the course; the outcome of all projects will be a short research paper. Depending on the class size, the projects may be completed in groups of up to three. The intent of the project is to get students think about a research problem, identify a research question, investigate it and write it up.

In this course, you will also be reading research papers and writing short response papers for each class in preparation, leading interactive paper discussion(s), and writing peer-reviews of papers.

## Leading Discussion
The signup sheet for the moderation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y14wnBWziRI04cflFy3RYsWQbmzub5m76Zs9ZbKoSpU/edit?usp=sharing)

Everyone in class has to lead the discussion for 2 papers over the course of the term. Each discussion session will be 40 minutes long. This includes a 10 minute introduction to the topic and paper, including some background, and a 30 minutes discussion that should be prepared beforehand and moderated in class. Please provide a brief (on paragraph or bullet list) description of your plan. 


## Research Project

The research project is the primary artifact of the course; the outcome of all projects will be a research paper (5 to 10 pages). Depending on the class size, the projects may be completed in groups of up to two. The intent of the project is to identify one or more research questions, investigate them and report the results in a scientific manner.

### Project Proposal Draft 
A one-page proposal for your project to me. The goal is to have something to discuss in the one-on-one meeting. The proposal has to include the problem/motivation for the project, the research question(s) and how you aim to address the research questions(s). This draft is important to be able to discuss the project ideas and help you express your ideas and us to understand what you are trying to do. However, the content and ideas are a lot more important than the formatting.

### Final Project Proposal 
A one- to two-page proposal for your project. Basically, this will be a revised version of your original draft, including the comments from the meeting and the format is more important.

### Proposal Presentation. 
A short (5 to 10 mins) presentation of the proposed project to the class. The goal is to share and discuss your ideas with multiple people.


## Response Papers
For each class in which we discuss papers, it is expected that you read the paper, write a response paper and hand in the response paper at 8pm the day before (by email). The response paper should be 300 - 500 words long and not more than a page and should cover all papers of the class. As stated in the introduction slides, while the response paper should contain a brief summary of the paper(s) it in not supposed to be just a summary and should capture your perspective, address all readings and draw conntections between them when possible. Some questions to think about when reading a paper and also when writing the response paper are: what are the main contributions of the paper, how does this work move the research forward, what are strengths and weaknesses, what could be improved/extended, how was the work validated, how does this research apply to you or in practice. 

A few sample response files from previous courses (that were slightly different to this course) are provided below:
* [Response Paper Sample 1](/sampleFiles/responsePaperSample_01.pdf)
* [Response Paper Sample 2](/sampleFiles/responsePaperSample_02.pdf)
* [Response Paper Sample 3](/sampleFiles/responsePaperSample_03.pdf)

## Academic Conduct

Each student is responsible for understanding and abiding by the University and Departmental policies on academic conduct. Specifically:

* [UBC policy on Academic Misconduct](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,959)
* [Computer Science Department Lab policies and responsibilities](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/our-department/administration/policies/collaboration)

### Respectful Environment

Everyone involved with this course is responsible for understanding and abiding by the University's Respectful Environment Statement.

The Statement of Principle of UBC's Respectful Environment Statement is "The best possible environment for working, learning and living is one in which respect, civility, diversity, opportunity and inclusion are valued. Everyone at the University of British Columbia is expected to conduct themselves in a manner that upholds these principles in all communications and interactions with fellow UBC community members and the public in all University-related settings."
